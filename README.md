## ðŸ”¹ Additional Challenges
Data Persistence

Store encrypted data in a JSON file instead of memory.
Load data on app startup.
Advanced Security Features

Time-based lockout for failed attempts.
Use PBKDF2 hashing instead of SHA-256 for extra security.
Multi-User System

Allow multiple users to store and retrieve their own data.
Use a user authentication system with Streamlit.
